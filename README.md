# Nature Adventures

Luonto is a website designed to allow people to share information about their favourite hiking routes with others.

The website aims to encourage people encourage each other to go outdoors by sharing advice and informatio with each other. Registered users of the website vote the routes to indicate to other users which routes they have liked.

### User Stories

Excel spreadsheet was used to collect epics and user stories before development was started. Four Epics were identified to help to organise the work: 1. User Profiles, 2. Routes, 3. Managing Routes and 4. Interacting with Routes. These Epics were broekn down into user stories with clearly definied Acceptance Criteria, Story Points and MoSCoW prioritisation.

Before development was started the User Stories were transferred to GitHub projects that was used as a Kanban board to track user stories and the progress made.
